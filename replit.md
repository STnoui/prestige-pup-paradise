# SHOLO Dog Breeding Website

## Overview

SHOLO is a modern dog breeding website built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture. The application showcases different dog breeds with detailed information and provides a platform for potential customers to learn about and contact the breeder. The site features a clean, modern design with multilingual support (English/Bulgarian) and dark/light theme switching.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but using in-memory storage currently)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context API for client state

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system focusing on shadows over borders
- **State Management**: 
  - React Query for server state management
  - Context API for language and theme preferences
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Currently using in-memory storage (MemStorage class) with interface for easy database migration
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, CORS handling
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user management with username/password authentication
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted CRUD operations ready for database implementation

### UI/UX Design System
- **Theme**: Clean, minimalist design with blue accent colors
- **Components**: Shadow-based design instead of borders
- **Typography**: Poppins font family
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-in and scale animations

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make requests through React Query
2. **API Routes**: Express server handles requests at `/api/*` endpoints
3. **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface allows for easy database switching
4. **Response Handling**: Structured JSON responses with error handling
5. **State Updates**: React Query manages cache and UI updates
